Family-based anlaysis could be conducted in in two ways:
1) Single family
2) Batch family

Both ways will use `slivar` installed by conda

#### Input files for slivar
1) All families bed file: `Data/family.bed`
2) All families merged vcf files: `Data/family11_merged.vcf.gz`

#### Running slivar
```bash

```
