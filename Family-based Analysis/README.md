Family based analysis will be performed simply by Python and R scripts, since the GATK and slivar always fail. 

### Input files
1. Family merged vcf.gz file: `F4_merged.vcf.gz`
2. Family ped file: `F4.ped`

### Command for analysis
```bash
newbornrisk='/mnt/storage_pool/Genomics/Genome/NewbornRisk'
bash NewbornRisk_family.sh \
  -i F4 \
  -o $newbornrisk/examples/F4 \
  -v $newbornrisk/examples/F4/F4_merged.vcf.gz \
  --ped $newbornrisk/examples/F4/F4.ped \
  --only-pass yes --genome GRCH38 --genedb TR
```
* feels like the --fork and --threads do not work, it stops the VEP processes

### UI design
#### Summary 
- Family Information: `F4_family_information.txt`
- Variant Highlights (three tabs):
  - Screen-positive Neonatal Diseases and Disease carrier status (Caused by ClinVar and ACMG (likely) pathogenic variants): `F4_plp_brief.txt`
  - Loss-of-function: `F4_high_brief.txt`
  - Other predicted variants: `F4_predict_brief.txt`
- Variant Pedigree Analysis: pedigree figures for each variant presented in files ends with `pedigree_plot.png`, such as `F4_BRCA1_c.2197_2201del_pedigree_plot.png` and `F4_C8B_c.1282C>T_pedigree_plot.png` \
(These pedigree plots are only generated for P/LP variants. There could be a RUN function for users to generate plots for other variants.)

#### Overall Variant Statistics
- VEP statistics and figures: `F4_vep_annotated.vcf.gz_summary.html`. The figures and tables could be used directly and presented in the web server. 
- Newborn Variant Statistics: `Kid0Pattern_P001_263_Variant_statistics.png`



#### Variant Details
`F4_detailed_table.txt`

#### PGx 
PGx results for each kids: files ends with `PGx.txt`, such as `F4_P001_263_PGx.txt`
